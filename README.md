# G-effects

This adds some acceleration and G effects into GeoFS. AriakimTaiyo made a script that would make the camera zoom in or out based on how much the aircraft is accelerating, and I added a section to black out the screen when you pull too many Gs.

File will be uploaded in a few minutes, I gotta test somth first.
